#A to do app made with PHP and Sqlite3

###how to run on your machine

####I'm running this on xampp in a folder named hey inside the htdocs folder
####So to access the page I'd go localhost/hey/index.php
####Also Sqlite3 is required on your machine

>1. clone the repo and copy/paste the files insde into xampp/htdocs/hey

>2. Type "localhost/hey/createUsersTable.php" without the quotes into the url. This will create a table called users into a test.db file for sqlite3 to use.

>3. now go to index.php and have fun :)
